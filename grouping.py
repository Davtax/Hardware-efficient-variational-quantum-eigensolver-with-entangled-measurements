"""
In order to simplify the programming, we use a numerical encoding to identify each Pauli string with an integer
I-> 0, X-> 1, Y-> 2, Z-> 3
Then, for example, XIZY would be mapped to the array [1, 0, 3, 2].

Similarly, we map measurements into numbers:
TPBX -> 1, TPBY -> 2, TPBZ -> 3, Bell -> 4, OmegaX -> 5, OmegaY -> 6, OmegaZ -> 7, chi -> 8, chi_tilde -> 9
(Note: if some measurement output has the number '0' it means that any measure is valid.)

Finally, we build lists of compatibility, one for each measurement. The list of compatibility of the measurement k 
should contain the arrays assigned to the Pauli strings that are compatible with that measurement. 
For instance, if we consider the measure 4 (Bell) its list of compatibility should contain [0,0], [1,1], [2,2], [3,3],
because the Bell measurement is compatible with II, XX, YY and ZZ, respectively.

Thus, when checking the compatibility of the strings v_i and v_j with the measurement k on the qubits (l, m), what we 
should do is checking if [v_i(l),v_i(m)] and [v_j(l),v_j(m)] are both in the compatibility list of the measurement k.
For example, if we had v_i = YIZZ = [2, 0, 3, 3] and v_j = XIZY = [1, 0, 3, 2], and we wanted to check if theses strings
are compatible with the measurement 4 (Bell) on the qubits (2, 3). What we have to do is checking if 
[v_i(2), v_i(3)] = [3, 3] and [v_j(2), v_j(2)] = [3, 2] are in the compatibility list of the measurement 4. As this
compatibility list is Comp_4 = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]], we have that [v_i(3), v_i(4)] belongs to Comp_4 but
[v_j(3), v_j(4)] does not. In consequence, the measurement 4 on the qubits (3, 4) is not compatible with v_i and v_j.

    """
    Given a set of Pauli strings (PS), this function makes groups of PS assigning taking into account the chip's
    connectivity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    PS: array (n, M)
        Pauli strings, each row represents a Pauli string while each the column represents a qubit. Thus, n is the
        number of Pauli strings and N is the number of qubits.
    G: nx.Graph or list (optional, default=None)
        Graph or list that represents the connectivity of the chip. If not provided, an all-to-all device is assumed.
    connected: bool (optional, default=False)
        If True the transpile algorithm ensures that the subgraph of the theoretical qubits in the chip is connected.
        Else, algorithm does not ensure that the subgraph of the theoretical qubits in the chip is connected, instead
        tries to optimize omega(T) in a greedy way.
    print_progress: bool (optional, default=False)
        If true, print the progress of the pauli graph and the grouping.

    Returns
    -------
    Groups: list
        The element in the position i is a list with the indexes of strings assigned to group i, i.e, the strings of
        group i.
    Measurement: list
        The element in position i is a list which represents measurement assigned to the group i. Each of these list is
        a list of partial measurements. Each partial measurements is a list of two elements. The first of these elements
        encodes the partial measurement assigned and the second the qubits where it should be performed.
    T: list
        T is the theo-phys map chosen. T[i]=j means that the i-theoretical qubit is mapped to the j-physical qubit.

    Â¡Important!: In 'Measurement' output the indexes that we use to refer to the qubits are theoretical indexes, not the
    correspondent physical indexes, i.e., if we have the i-theoretical qubit is mapped to the j-physical qubit through
    T, in other words T[i]=j, we use the index i and not the j to refer to that qubit.
