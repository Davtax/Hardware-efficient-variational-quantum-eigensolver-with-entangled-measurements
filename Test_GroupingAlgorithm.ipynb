For example, if we had $v_i=YIZZ=[2,0,3,3]$ and $v_j=XIZY=[1,0,3,2]$ and we wanted to check if theses strings are compatible with the measurement 4 (the Bell measurement) on the qubits (3,4), what we have to do is checking if $[v_i(3),v_i(4)]=[3,3]$ and $[v_j(3),v_j(4)]=[3,2]$ are in the compatibility list of the measurement 4. As this compatibility list is $Comp_4=\\{[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]\\}$, we have that $[v_i(3),v_i(4)]$ belongs to $Comp_4$ but $[v_j(3),v_j(4)]$ does not.
